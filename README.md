# ETH Address Poisoning Tool

A full python tool for simulating Ethereum address poisoning attacks for educational and security research purposes. This tool generates vanity addresses that mimic a target address and sends nominal transactions to execute the poisoning of a user's transaction history.

## How It Works

This tool automates the address poisoning for security testing:

1.  **Scan:** The tool scan the network for USDT transfers.
2.  **Vanity Address Generation:** The tool generates addresses that match a specified number of prefix and suffix characters of the target address.
3.  **Transaction Simulation:** Using a provided RPC endpoint and private key, the tool sends a configurable, near-zero value transaction from each generated vanity address to the target address.
4.  **Logging:** The tool outputs the generated addresses and corresponding transaction hashes for analysis.
